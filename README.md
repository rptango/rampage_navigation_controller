# Rally Navigation Controller
This is my adjusted version of the Rampage bluetooth handlebar navigation controller made by Eugene Beetge from Rally Rampage. 
General difference with original project is to adapt it to my preference of using Drive Mode Dashboard v2 Map application, Waze and Spotify/Media as profiles.

This project is made using a adafruit 32u4 board
